When you click move down, it moves the circle down by 20 px each instance.
If you do make invisible, it will hide the circle no matter how many times triggered

6.
It opens a window where I can input a color

9. 
To make the house I generate 2 squares, making one black and the other bigger and red.
I overlay both squares. 
I generate a triangle and move its postion on top of the red square
I increase the triangles size.
I make a yellow circle
I move it to the right of the house
